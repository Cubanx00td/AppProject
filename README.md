## Self Ordering Kiosk Project

This project aims to develop a user-friendly Self-Ordering Kiosk Interface for restaurants, utilizing JavaFX and Scene Builder. The interface is designed to streamline the ordering process, emphasizing user experience and efficient payment processing. By minimizing wait times and optimizing sales, the project seeks to enhance restaurant operations and customer satisfaction.

## Key Features

- Simple design
- Easy to use interface
- Bill and taxes calculations

## Technologies Used

- JavaFX: Utilized for linking the frontend to the backend, defining functions for buttons, and processing user input.
- Scene Builder: Used to design different scenes such as homepage and order summary.

## Project Structure

All project files are organized within the `src` directory. The structure includes:

- Controllers: Contains Java files defining functions for various interface functionalities.
- FXML Files: Contains XML-based files created using Scene Builder to define the graphical user interface.
- PNG Files: Contains images used in the frontend.

## Setup

To set up the project, ensure you have Java JDK and JavaFX installed. Follow these basic instructions:

1. Install Java JDK.
2. Install JavaFX. I used Liberca JDK with version 17.
3. If you're using Java 9 or later, JavaFX is not part of the Java Development Kit (JDK) by default. You'll need to explicitly add the JavaFX modules to your project's module-info.java file.

## Usage

Simply run the project after setup to launch the Self-Ordering Kiosk Interface. Follow the on-screen instructions to place orders and complete transactions.
